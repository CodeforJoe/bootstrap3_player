An HTML5 Audio Player Skin For Twitter Bootstrap 3

#### Requires:

  * Twitter Bootstrap 3 - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
  * jQuery - http://jquery.com/

#### How to use

Clone or download this repo; then open the included [`index.html`](index.html) file: 
-  with **your browser** to:  
    -  see a live demo on your local machine 
    -  compare it with the [screenshots or live demo](#screenshots) below
- with your [text editor](index.html) to:
    -  see all the css and js files you need to link to
    -  see the `<audio>`  tags in use

#### Styling caveat

Works best when the player is not enclosed in too narrow a container in which case controls can appear jumbled. The seek and volume sliders are hidden on narrow (xs) viewports and stack in very narrow situations. However, this is not an entirely satisfactory solution. Please raise an issue if this compromise doesn't suit your use case. 

#### Forked from William Randol's [bootstrap-player](https://github.com/WilliamRandol/bootstrap-player)

 -  `bootstrap-player` is great for Bootstrap 2
 -  All the functionality of William Randol's player is preserved   
 (QUnit / FuncUnit test suite in progress :waxing_crescent_moon:)
 -  `bootstrap3_player` updates the styling of `bootstrap-player`; has fewer dependencies; uses Bootstrap 3

For some info on the differences between `bootstrap-player` and `bootstrap3_player`, [see here.](CHANGES.md)
