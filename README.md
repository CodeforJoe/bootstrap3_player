#### Forked from William Randol's [bootstrap-player](https://github.com/WilliamRandol/bootstrap-player)

 -  `bootstrap-player` is great for Bootstrap 2
 -  All the functionality of William Randol's player is preserved   
 (QUnit / FuncUnit test suite in progress :waxing_crescent_moon:)
 -  `bootstrap3_player` updates the styling of `bootstrap-player`; has fewer dependencies; uses Bootstrap 3
